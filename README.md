### Case to solve    
- Create relational database and work with it through Django Shell.
- Make views of the whole model elements in tab and of the every element as well with ListView and DetailView generics. Apply filters and tags.
- Create 'censor' filter.
- html-code to work at templates with views and forms.
- GET and POST parameters at HTTP-requests.
- DeleteView, UpdateView, CreateView generics.
<p> </p>

- Two different ways to register and log in: full and via e-mail/social account.
- Add users to different groups via admin and registration. Exclusive permissions via admin.
- Check user permissions at views and templates.


**Practice to**     
- describe models,
- create database,
- input data to database,
- fill connections between tables,
- receive data from connected tables,
- create views with generics,
- work with templates,
- routing,
- create own filters and tags,
- combine filtration and pagination on one page,
- add forms to edit and update objects, delete objects.
<p> </p>

- add different registration views and apply extra functionality at them.
- close add/change/delete views from users without permissions.
- open navigation in templates for users with permissions only.
- work with permissions at admin panel.
